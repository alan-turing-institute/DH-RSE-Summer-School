# Software Development Lifecycle

On the fourth day of the Summer School, we will look at processes to manage the development of RSE projects.

We'll begin with an introduction from **Neil Jakeman** with an overview of how [King's Digital Lab](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk) came into existence and the how managing the legacy of 30 years of DH work forced the new Lab to develop more resilient processes.

This introduction will segue into a description of KDL's Software Development Lifecycle, a collection of processes and documentation that can be found in a __white__ __label__ form on GitHub [here](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/sdlc-for-rse/wiki).

The morning break will be followed by a session with **Edd Salkield** and **Elliott Hughes** of [Dreaming Spires](https://dreamingspires.dev/), who will talk about the imporatance of integrating design thinking into the iterative development process from the outset.

Following lunch we will break the attendees into groups of 4 or 5 to evaluate an imaginary project scenario. The aim here will be to try out some of the processes and templates discussed in the morning sessions, and to encourage thinking about how to define requirements and dependencies.

The after-lunch session is a long slog in front of a Zoom session, so we'll take another short break before Dreaming Spires lead us on another activity, evaluating design.

Toward the end of the afternoon, Neil of KDL, will talk about the difficulties of implementing an SDLC with a diversity of project types.

Finally, before wrap up with Edd Salkield speaking about his path into an RSE career, and the particular model that Dreaming Spires have followed.
