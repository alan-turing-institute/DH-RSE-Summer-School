# Collaboration

The first day of the Summer School will focus on how to work collaboratively. 
We are going to cover best practices and pathways to contribute to open-source projects, to review code and give each-other feedbacks.

After a general introduction to the Summer School, the day will be kick off with a talk from **Barbara McGillivray** on her experience as the first researchers with a Humanities background working at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK national institute for data science and artificial intelligence.

Next, **Ruth Ahnert and David Beavan** will present their experience on working together on the Living with Machines project, a large-scale collaboration between historians, data scientists, geographers, computational linguists, software engineers and curators have been brought together to examine the human impact of industrial revolution. This programme, funded by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Strategic Priority Fund, is a multidisciplinary collaboration delivered by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), with The Alan Turing Institute, the British Library and the Universities of Cambridge, East Anglia, Exeter, and Queen Mary University of London. 

After the lunch break we are going to move to the more hands-on part of the day.
In the afternoon, **Kasra Hosseini, Mariona Coll Ardanuy and Federico Nanni** will present a collaborative activity focused on learning gitflow while contributing to the open source digital humanities tool DeezyMatch. For more information see the README in the `gitflow` folder.

The day will be concluded by an RSE Story by **Giovanni Colavizza**, who will share his path in between digital history, computer science and research data science. After a 15-minute overview of his career path, there will be a 45-minute discussion period so the audience can ask their own questions about Giovanni's experience as an RSE.

## Presenters and Organisers

This day is organised by the Turing [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering), the [Humanities and Data Science Interest Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/humanities-and-data-science) and the [Living with Machines](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) team. 

The speakers of the day are: 

- **[Federico Nanni](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/federico-nanni)** is a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute, working as part of the Research Engineering Group. He is a historian by training and works exploring the intersections between digital humanities, computational social science, research software engineering and natural language processing.
- Barbara McGillivray
- **[Ruth Ahnert](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/ruth-ahnert)** is a Professor of Literary History and Digital Humanities at Queen Mary University of London, and Principal Investigator on the Living with Machines Project at The Alan Turing Institute. Her background is in Early Modern English literature and book history, but over the last 10 years has been collaborating more and more with data scientists.
- **[David Beavan](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/david-beavan)** is a Senior Research Software Engineer in the Research Engineering Group at The Alan Turing Institute, and Research Affiliate at the University of Edinburgh Centre for Data, Culture & Society (CDCS). He has been working in the Digital Humanities (DH) for over 15 years, working collaboratively, applying cutting edge computational methods to explore new humanities challenges.
- - **[Kasra Hosseini](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kasra-hosseini)** is a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute. He is interested in (artificially) intelligent systems, machine learning, inverse theory, uncertainty estimation, and data analysis and visualisation.
- **[Mariona Coll Ardanuy](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/mariona-coll-ardanuy)** is a post-doctoral research associate at The Alan Turing Institute in the Living with Machines project. She is a computational linguist interested in the application of natural language processing to humanities research.
- Giovanni Colavizza
