#  Software Sustainability

The second day of the Summer School will focus on how to make sustainable software. 
We are going to cover best practices and pathways to build reusable open-source projects.

After a general introduction, the day will be kick off with a talk from **Alexis Litvine** on his experience on the THOTH project, focused on Transcribing Historical Objects with Tabulated Handwriting.

Next, **Mahmoud Abdelrazek** will discuss about another project at the intersection of Digital Humanities and Research Software Engineering: MAEASaM, a. research on Mapping Africa’s Endangered Archaeological Sites and Monuments.

The morning will wrap up with an introduction to software sustainability practices, the focus of the afternoon coding activities. After the lunch break we are going to move to the more hands-on part of the day.

In the afternoon, **Mary Chester-Kadwell** and **Andrea Kocsis** will present a coding activity focused on learning best practices in software sustainability.

The day will be concluded by an RSE Story by **Mary Chester-Kadwell**, who will share her path in between digital archaeology, software engineering and pedagogy of coding. After a 15-minute overview of her career path, there will be a 45-minute discussion period so the audience can ask their own questions about Mary's experience. She will be joined by **Mahmoud Abdelrazek** during the open discussion for an alternative perspective.
