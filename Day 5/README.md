# DH&RSE: Present and Future

After four days focused on specific topics and projects, the final day of the Summer School will bring you a broader view of the present and future of the community growing at the intersection of Digital Humanities & Research Software Engineering.

The day will be kick off with a talk from **Jane Winters** on the Digital Humanities research and teaching landscape in the UK, including both higher education and the cultural heritage sector. She will also briefly present some recent initiatives to develop cross-sectoral and transnational collaboration in the field.

Next, **David De Roure** on the landscape of Research Software Engineers, focusing on arts, humanities and cultural heritage. The talk will also feature the Software Sustainability Institute and UKRI research and Innovation infrastructure activities in this area.

Having seen many examples of projects that sit at the intersection of research software engineering and digital humanities during the summer school, you will have the chance of discussing with the speakers on how they foreseen this landscape changing in the next years.

After the lunch break we are going to move to the more hands-on part of the day.
In the afternoon, **Sarah Gibson, Kaspar Beelen and Federico Nanni** will present a collaborative activity focused on the use of Binder, an open source service that provides your code and the hardware and software to execute it. The project is supported by Google Cloud, OVH, GESIS Notebooks and The Alan Turing Institute. Together, we will experiment on how to adopt it to test a series of language models developed as part of the Living with Machines project.

The day will be concluded by an RSE Story by **Olivia Vane**, a data visualisation designer, engineer and researcher. Olivia works with large cultural datasets, for example digitised collections of paintings, photographs, artefacts, maps, and newspapers. She is a Research Software Engineer at the British Library and The Alan Turing Institute on the 'Living with Machines' research project. After a 15-minute overview of her career path, there will be a 45-minute discussion period so the audience can ask their own questions about Olivia's experience.

## Presenters and Organisers

This day is organised by the Turing [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering), the [Humanities and Data Science Interest Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/humanities-and-data-science) and the [Living with Machines](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/) team. 

The speakers of the day are: 

- **[Federico Nanni](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/federico-nanni)** is a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute, working as part of the Research Engineering Group. He is a historian by training and works exploring the intersections between digital humanities, computational social science, research software engineering and natural language processing.
- **[Jane Winters](https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/126/professor-jane-winters)** is Professor of Digital Humanities & Pro-Dean for Libraries at the School of Advanced Study, University of London. She has led or co-directed a range of digital projects, including most recently the UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Association: a Network for Research Capacity Enhancement. 
- **[David De Roure](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/david-de-roure)** David De Roure is Professor of e-Research in the Engineering Science Department at the University of Oxford, and a Turing Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute. David has a longstanding interest in research infrastructure, including computational methods, automation, and software sustainability.
- **[Sarah Gibson](https://sgibson91.github.io/)** is an Open Source Infrastructure Engineer at 2i2c, an open source contributor and advocate. She holds more than two years of experience as a Research Engineer as part of the Turing Research Engineering Group, as well as holding a core contributor role in the open source projects Binder, JupyterHub, and The Turing Way.
- **[Kaspar Beelen](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kaspar-beelen)** is a digital historian, who explores the application of machine learning to humanities research, as part of the Living with Machines project.
- **[Olivia Vane](https://www.oliviavane.co.uk/)** is a Research Software Engineer at the British Library and The Alan Turing Institute on the 'Living with Machines' research project, combining large-scale digitised historical collections with data science and data visualisations techniques.
